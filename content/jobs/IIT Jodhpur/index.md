- Developed MLVICX, a framework designed to extract actionable insights from large and unstructured medical datasets. It streamlined the process of building models on complex healthcare data.

- Addressed inefficiencies in medical image analysis within the MIMIC dataset by applying BYOL. This improved feature representations significantly, enabling more accurate downstream diagnostic tasks.

- Implemented BERT, Bio-BERT, and SQL to efficiently extract, query, and analyze structured and unstructured healthcare records. This integration enabled real-time insights and reduced manual overhead in handling clinical data.

- Enhanced model robustness using VICReg for optimized loss calculation. This reduced sensitivity to noisy inputs and improved stability across multiple medical prediction tasks.
